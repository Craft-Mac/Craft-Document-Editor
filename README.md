## What is Craft?

![Craft Document Example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSvEvEsDD3deYoSpAdCyZozVRBDuVE_CR0zWg&s)

Craft is a powerful and intuitive document editor that transforms how you capture, organize, and present your ideas. It moves beyond traditional text editors by utilizing a flexible block-based system, allowing you to effortlessly structure your content with text, images, videos, code snippets, and tables. Each document is a collection of these movable blocks, giving you unparalleled control over the layout and feel of your work.

One of the standout features of this application is its superior organization capabilities. You can create nested pages within documents, building a hierarchical structure for complex projects. The built-in bidirectional linking allows you to seamlessly connect related ideas across your entire library of notes, effectively building a personal wiki. This makes it an exceptional tool for managing knowledge, whether for individual use or within a collaborative team environment.

Craft also excels in sharing and collaboration. You can invite others to edit documents with you in real-time, seeing changes as they happen. For public sharing, any document can be published to a beautiful, responsive webpage with a single click, without any formatting loss. With its deep integration with the Apple ecosystem, including robust iCloud syncing, your work is always up to date and accessible across all your devices. Craft document editor is designed for those who value both aesthetics and functionality in their digital workspace.
